    "# Introduction\n",
    "My cousin Morgan and his wife Lauren are expecting their second child. I asked them what names they are considering. They don't know *what* name they want to give the baby, but they do know what *kind* of name they want to give it. Normal, but not *too* common. You know, distinctive, but not *too* weird. A just-right \"Goldilocks\" name. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Goldilocks's own parents have demonstrated, it's a matter of taste whether a name is TOO common or TOO weird. But I suggested to Morgan that as long as he could put some quantative parameters on too common, he could use naming statistics to generate candidate baby names that are *objectively the *best* names for them. It's almost like SCIENCE! Nerd that I am, I decided to take this tongue in cheek project to the internet. This program gives you the top baby names from Social Security data 1880-2022, but allows you to filter your list a few different ways for what is \"too normal.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "So Morg, here's the deal. The initial filters I suggest using here are my best guesses about what kind of names would hit the sweet spot of \"normal but not TOO normal\" for YOU two specifically. You can adjust the values and rerun this code as many times as you like, of course, but tell me how close I got! Also, if you name your baby by using this code, you are legally obligated to make me a godparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does this work? \n",
    "If you have never used a code notebook before, here are some instructions. A notebook has cells of regular text (like this one) interspersed with cells of code that you can run (like the next one). \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend hiding the code cells to make the interactive parts of this easier to see. Go to the menu at the top, and select View > Collapse All Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then select Run > Run All Cells\n",
    "It may take a minute to import the name data, but then it should start printing more instructions for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to rerun just part of the program, you can also run the code cells one at a time. To run just one cell, click on it to select it, and then press the Play button at the top or select Run > Run Selected Cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must run the first set-up cell every time you open this website, but after that you can run any of the other cells as many times as you like during that session. "

    "# Bonus Feature: Unisex Names\n",
    "Morg, remember how I mentioned women with masculine names have been shown to succeed more in STEM and business? Want to see a list of names that have been used for both male and female babies recently? In the entire dataset, there are more than 11,000 names that have been registered for both girls and boys, but most of them are used overwhelmingly for one sex, with just few outliers of the other. Maybe you want to see names where only 5% of the babies cross the gender line, or maybe you would rather see names that are closer to 50-50. So next you will need to specify the level of gender neutrality you want these names to have, by specifying a minimum percentage of time the name should have been used for girls and boys. Run the next code block to see these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting side note: \"Unisex\" names almost always start as masculine names. When unisex names become popular as female name, parents have historically abandoned them as male names. This is why 98% of Ashleys and Leslies are female now, whereas 100% of them were male at the turn of the century, for example. However, I've found at least one recent exceptions to this rule: Shannon has a very long history as ambisexual, but after reaching a low of 4% male in the 90s, Shannon has slowly been regaining ground for males since the 2000s, with male use being 30-42% in the last five years. I wonder if this name is an exception or if there is more of this happening due to recent generations' more flexible attitudes towards gender?"
