    "# Introduction\n",
    "My cousin Morgan and his wife Lauren are expecting their second child. I asked them what names they are considering. They don't know *what* name they want to give the baby, but they do know what *kind* of name they want to give it. Normal, but not *too* common. You know, distinctive, but not *too* weird. A just-right \"Goldilocks\" name. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Goldilocks's own parents have demonstrated, it's a matter of taste whether a name is TOO common or TOO weird. But I suggested to Morgan that as long as he could put some quantative parameters on too common, he could use naming statistics to generate candidate baby names that are *objectively the *best* names for them. It's almost like SCIENCE! Nerd that I am, I decided to take this tongue in cheek project to the internet. This program gives you the top baby names from Social Security data 1880-2022, but allows you to filter your list a few different ways for what is \"too normal.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "So Morg, here's the deal. The initial filters I suggest using here are my best guesses about what kind of names would hit the sweet spot of \"normal but not TOO normal\" for YOU two specifically. You can adjust the values and rerun this code as many times as you like, of course, but tell me how close I got! Also, if you name your baby by using this code, you are legally obligated to make me a godparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does this work? \n",
    "If you have never used a code notebook before, here are some instructions. A notebook has cells of regular text (like this one) interspersed with cells of code that you can run (like the next one). You can read along, and run the code cells one at a time as you go. To run each cell of code, just select the cell, and click of the play button either directly to the left of it or in the top menu. The output of the code will appear below the cell. Many of them ask you for input--those prompts will appear right below the cell, so you may need to scroll down to see them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, run the set-up cell directly below this one. You only need to run this once per session, then you can rerun any the other cells as many times as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell may take a minute or two to run, so be patient. It will say Done! below it when it is finished. The other cells will be faster."

    "# Bonus Feature: Ambisexual Names\n",
    "Morg, remember how I mentioned women with masculine names have been shown to succeed more in STEM and business? Want to see a list of names that have been used for both male and female babies recently? In the entire dataset, there are more than 11,000 names that have been registered for both girls and boys, but most of them are used overwhelmingly for one sex, with just few outliers of the other. Maybe you want to see names where only 5% of the babies cross the gender line, or maybe you would rather see names that are closer to 50-50. So next you will need to specify the level of gender neutrality you want these names to have, by specifying a minimum percentage of time the name should have been used for girls and boys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting side note: Ambisexual names almost always start as masculine names. When ambisexual names become popular as female name, parents have historically abandoned them as male names. This is why 98% of Ashleys and Leslies are female now, whereas 100% of them were male at the turn of the century, for example. However, I've found at least one recent exceptions to this rule: Shannon has a very long history as ambisexual, but after reaching a low of 4% male in the 90s, Shannon has slowly been regaining ground for males since the 2000s, with male use being 30-42% in the last five years. I wonder if this name is an exception or if there is more of this happening due to recent generations' more flexible attitudes towards gender?"
